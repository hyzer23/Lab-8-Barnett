            Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a third year student at KU studying Computer Science.
            I have many hobbies which includes skateboarding, video games, playing guitar, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2JPFb4t1L3cQU68Opxnq7Q?si=Csh6mRU6Sm2iodeokLkGgQ"> making music.</a>
            With so many hobbies, I enjoy learning all that I can about each, and I also like to spread that knowledge to others. Linked below are some resources that I think will help a beginner 
            who wants to learn how to do their first skateboarding trick, how to play their first chords on guitar, and how to build a gaming PC. <br />
